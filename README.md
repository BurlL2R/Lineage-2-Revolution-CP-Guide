### A General Guide to CP and Equipment in Lineage 2: Revolution
This guide was written by Burl, aka Naito, of the Vasper server. 
While this is a lengthy guide, it is not intended to be comprehensive.
There will be missing information and errors.
There's a good reason it is called a "general reference."

This was written in LaTeX, using Texlive 2019 revision 51555 and TeXstudio 2.12.16.
